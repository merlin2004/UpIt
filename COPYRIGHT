Clarification:
    .
    The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
    software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
    be valid for this artwork library too.
    .
    KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
    artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
    GUI.
    .
    Source code, for this library means:
    - where they exist, SVG;
    - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
    otherwise png.
    .
    The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
    notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
    .
    With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
    containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
    .
    The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
    the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
